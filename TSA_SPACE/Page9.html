<h1>Now you might be wondering how much does it cost for us to take you to space?</h1>
Well, first of all, you have gotta consider these main 3 things: the price of rocket fuel, space flight training, and
both staff as well as the place you will be staying. Altogether this is around $1,500,000.00. Space flight is not cheap;
however, we wanna be able to ensure that everything goes according to plan and that everyone has a good time while doing
so.
