    <h1>None of this would be possible without our intensive training procedures you must go through first:</h1>

    Going to space is a big deal, and are staff feel the same way. Before you can even think about going into space you
    have to take a 15-day course where you will undergo all kinds of training to prepare you for space. You will run
    simulations of anti-gravity, and even practice going to the bathroom. (For space of course.) This process is
    rigorous due to the severity of the matter. Space isnâ€™t something to mess around with and that is why we train all
    guests before they can take flight.
