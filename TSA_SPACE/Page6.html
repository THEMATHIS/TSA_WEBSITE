    <h1> What we do to ensure a safe trip with recovery </h1>

    Now by the slim chance that any failures occur while booking a flight to one of our hotels, the staff is ready and
    prepared to put your life as a priority above anything else. Our ships are specially designed with a temporary heat
    shield for if someone somehow was able to get out of their seat during lift-off. This device will create a big
    bubble that reduces the pressure that a person may feel, and if that person is out of their seat itâ€™ll give them or
    time to sit down before it deteriorates. Although, this is not the only protocol staff have in place; say for
    instance someone requires medical assistance while in flight. Our staff got you covered, they will make sure you are
    treated and taken care of accordingly.
