    <h1> Our launch procedures </h1>
    <br>
    <p>    </p>Here at Hotel Spacelines, we strive to make sure when our guests are taking off on a trip that they have the
    utmost safety while doing so. Before the launch, our staff go and make sure everyone is buckled into their seat
    belts, and thoroughly secured. Then the pilot will activate a lock to where no one can take the seat belts off
    until we are past Earthâ€™s atmosphere. After that, our passengers will be able to get up and socialize with other
    guests aboard our ship. We will also make several pits stops everyone can take care of their business along the
    way. Once we arrive at our said destination each passenger will be equipped with a space suit to roam
    around. Of course, they will be able to take them off once they get to one of our many hotels on said planet.
