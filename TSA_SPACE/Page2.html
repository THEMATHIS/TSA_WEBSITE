    <h1>What weâ€™ll do to ensure your safety while operating these vehicles.</h1>

    Although most of the training covers how to be a responsible driver in space if something were to happen to you just
    know all vehicles have trackers on them so we know where you are at during all times. If you were to get lost we
    have teams of trained professionals who will go and rescue you. There is also a distress signal which can be sent
    via a button located on the back of the rover.
